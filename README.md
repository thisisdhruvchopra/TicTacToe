# TicTacToe
I made a lil tictactoe game using core java with no external libraries except util. It covers 2d arrays, Strings, characters, inheritance, loops and recursion. 
When you're playing with the computer. The computer automatically select the best moves either for it to win or for u NOT to win. But again, You can easily beat this AI if You use some of your tictactoe tricks.
This computer is not super smart as it should be. It has a few flaws but meh, I could only cramp up 600 lines of codes in one night.
I donot know AI as of now. I am going to pursue it to make such simple projects hell lot easier and shorter. 
This is my first project made with the basics I know as of July 1, 2021 and it is just raw computer coding that i have done here. Only this much was taught to me in ISC BOARD. I am now going to broaden my horizon as I am fairly good at this but I am limited to my current knowledge. I need to know more tools like AI and ML to make my life alot easier and to make my algorithims put to use without limiting myself with just the basics and syntaxes that i know.
